# Maya-To-Renderman-Shaders-conversion
Script to convert standard maya shaders (Phong, Blinn, Lambert) to RenderMan PxrSurface.

Original script is from https://www.highend3d.com/maya/script/maya-materials-to-arnold-materials-for-maya by Mahmoud Youssef,
I modified that to work with RenderMan.


USE:
Select the shaders to convert and run the script.


INSTALL:
Open/copypaste the script in the maya script editor.
Select all the script (ctrl+A) and run the script (ctrl+RETURN)
OR
Select all the script (ctrl+A), drag it with middle mouse button on your Custom shelf.



Send me issues if there's need to add more parameters conversion or to switch one to another one.

TODO:
convert shaders of selected meshes instead of selected shaders.
